export const aboutMe = `
I'm a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in backend architecture, frontend design, and rapid prototyping.
I specialize in building dynamic, recruiter-optimized portfolios using modern frameworks like React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
My work blends technical precision with UI/UX polish, SEO strategy, and branding clarity. I thrive in fast-paced environments,
quickly adapting to new tools and troubleshooting live deployment issues with resilience and resourcefulness. Whether architecting
scalable APIs or refining pixel-perfect interfaces, I align every project with real-world impact and career outcomes. Iâ€™m passionate
about clean code, modular design, and delivering production-ready solutions.`;
