// About me
export const aboutMe = `I\’m a Frontend Engineer with 6+ years of experience building high‑scale React and Angular applications for enterprise and customer‑facing platforms. My work blends strong frontend engineering with a growing foundation in machine learning, supported by my Master\’s in Data Science from the Illinois Institute of Technology. I\’m passionate about creating fast, accessible, and intuitive user experiences while also exploring how ML‑driven insights can enhance product decision‑making and personalization.\n\n
I specialize in TypeScript, Angular, RxJS, NgRx, and modern frontend tooling, with additional experience in React, Vite, and Tailwind. Across roles at Cognizant and TD Bank, I\’ve led the development of complex dashboards, built large reusable component systems, and driven architectural decisions that improved scalability, performance, and bundle efficiency. I enjoy mentoring engineers, conducting thoughtful code reviews, and shaping engineering practices that elevate quality across teams.\n\n
My data science background gives me a deeper understanding of analytics, model‑driven features, and how ML systems integrate with frontend applications. I\’m particularly interested in interfaces that surface predictions, insights, and real‑time data in meaningful ways.
I\’m looking for frontend roles on product‑driven, high‑growth teams where I can combine strong UI engineering with data‑informed thinking to build impactful user experiences.
