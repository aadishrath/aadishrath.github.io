    repo: 'https://github.com/aadishrath/housePrediction',
    details: `This project builds and evaluates multiple machine learning models to predict house prices based on various features. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. The best performing combination for each model is saved and later used for prediction via React UI.

      - Data preprocessing: cleaning, scaling, and feature selection
      - Model training: using six different regression algorithms
      - Hyperparameter tuning: via GridSearchCV with cross-validation
      - Evaluation: using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score
      - Model saving: best models, scalers, and selected features are saved for predictions through React UI

    ## 🔍 Models Used
      The following models are trained and tuned:
        - Linear Regression: baseline model with no hyperparameters
        - Decision Tree Regressor (labeled as "Ridge Regression"):
          - max_depth, min_samples_split
        - Random Forest Regressor:
          - n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split
        - Support Vector Machine (SVR):
          - C, kernel, gamma
        - XGBoost Regressor:
          - n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, subsample
        - Neural Network (MLPRegressor):
          - hidden_layer_sizes, activation, learning_rate_init

      Each model undergoes feature selection using either:
        - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for linear models
        - SelectFromModel for tree-based models

    ## 🧹 Dropped Features Before Training
      Certain features were dropped prior to model training due to the following reasons:

        | Feature       | Reason for Dropping                                     |
        |---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
        | id            | Unique identifier; no predictive value                  |
        | date          | Timestamp of sale; not useful without temporal modeling |
        | sqft_basement | Highly correlated with sqft_living and sqft_above       |
        | yr_renovated  | Mostly zeros; sparse and not informative                |

      These features either introduced noise, redundancy, or lacked meaningful variance. Dropping them improved model interpretability and reduced overfitting risk.


    ## 📊 Dataset
      The dataset contains housing features and sale prices. Key input features include:
        - bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, waterfront, view, condition, grade
        - yr_built, lat, long, sqft_living, sqft_lot, zipcode, etc.
        - price (target variable)

    repo: 'https://github.com/aadishrath/MatchPredictor',
    details: `In this project, I built and trained logistic regression model using TensorFlow, PyTorch and Scikit-Learn library. This project has large league of legends dataset with 9 columns and 1000 rows. win is the target feature and kills, deaths, assists, gold-earned, cs, wards_placed, wards_killed, damage_dealt are input features.
            
    ## Introduction
      League of Legends, a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, generates extensive data from matches, providing an excellent opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world scenarios. Performed the following steps to build a logistic regression model aimed at predicting the outcomes of League of Legends matches.

    ## Dataset
      Sample from the dataset:

      | win	| kills	| deaths | assists | gold_earned | cs	 | wards_placed | wards_killed | damage_dealt |
